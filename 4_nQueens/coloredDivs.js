/*
Using d3, append the data below to our 'body' tag using 'div's. Your code should
1. change the color/fill of the 'enter' selection to its value in the data array
2. should NOT change the color for the update selection (if it exists).
3. should remove the exit selection (if it exists).

You can assume you have a 'body' tag, but cannot assume how many divs will already be
appended to said tag.
